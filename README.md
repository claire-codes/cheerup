# CheerUp

My First [Very Daft] Ruby Gem

Having a bad day? Need cheering up? Get your Mac to say something cheery to you with this Gem - although Mac isn't having a great day either.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cheerup'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cheerup

## Usage

From the command line:
    
    $ cheer up

Also accepts an optional name arg if you want to be more personal.

    $ cheer up Antony


## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/claireparker/cheerup, although I probably don't know how to fix it.

_Wittier ways to cheer someone up are particularly welcome._


## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
